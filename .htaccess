# Remove .php extension from URLs (e.g., example.com/page instead of example.com/page.php)
# This rule matches any URL that doesn't contain a dot (.) before the end of the string
# The [NC] flag makes it case-insensitive, [L] means this is the last rule to process if matched
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]

# Remove .html extension from URLs (similar to above but for .html files)
# Note: This rule will never be reached because the previous rule will always match first
# You should combine these or prioritize one over the other
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L]

# The following conditions prevent infinite loops and ensure we only rewrite valid requests
# Only process the rewrite if the requested filename is not an existing file
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# Only process the rewrite if the requested filename is not an existing directory

# Force HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
# Checks if the server port is 80 (standard HTTP port)
# Note: This rule is incomplete - needs a RewriteRule to actually perform the redirect
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
