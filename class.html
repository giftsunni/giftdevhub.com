What is HTML5?

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) — the standard language used to create web pages.
It tells a browser what content to display (text, images, videos, links) and how it is structured, but not usually how it looks (that’s the job of CSS).

2. The First Line: <!DOCTYPE html>

Before anything else, every HTML5 document begins with:

<!DOCTYPE html>

Why it’s important:

It tells the browser: "This is an HTML5 document".

Helps the browser render the page in standards mode (modern, correct rendering).

It is not case-sensitive (you can write <!doctype html>), but the uppercase version is the common convention.

3. The Basic Structure of an HTML5 Page

Here’s the smallest valid HTML5 page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML5 Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>mndnlndlknclkd</h1>
  
</body>
</html>

Breaking it down:

1. <!DOCTYPE html> – tells the browser to use HTML5.


2. <html lang="en"> – the root element of the HTML page; lang="en" specifies the language (English here).


3. <head> – contains page metadata (info about the page, not visible on the page itself):

<meta charset="UTF-8"> → sets character encoding so special characters display correctly.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> → makes your page mobile-friendly.

<title> → sets the page’s title in the browser tab.



4. <body> – contains all the visible content of the page (headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.).

Built-in audio & video support (<audio>, <video>).

Form improvements (new input types like email, date, range).
